    "# Hands-on: Evaluating AI-Generated Text: Automatic Metrics vs. Human Judgments\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world applications like news aggregation, research briefs, or internal company reports, AI models can automatically generate summaries to save time and reduce human effort.\n",
    "In this lab, we explore how to evaluate AI-generated summaries using automatic metrics and compare these evaluations with human judgments. The objective is to understand not only whether the generated text is relevant, fluent, and coherent, but also how closely automatic evaluation aligns with human intuition.\n",

    "    \"Researchers at a leading technology lab have developed an advanced AI system capable of generating highly realistic 3D models from simple 2D sketches. This breakthrough has the potential to transform workflows in the gaming and film industries, where designers can now quickly prototype complex scenes. The AI uses a combination of generative modeling techniques and neural rendering, allowing it to understand depth, texture, and perspective from minimal input. Researchers believe this tool could drastically reduce the time and cost associated with creating 3D assets while democratizing access for smaller studios and independent creators.\",\n",
    "    \"A new reinforcement learning algorithm has been introduced that allows autonomous robots to navigate extremely complex and dynamic environments with very little human intervention. The algorithm combines advanced path planning, obstacle avoidance, and real-time decision-making capabilities. It has been tested in indoor and outdoor scenarios, including cluttered warehouse environments and uneven terrain. Engineers report that the system adapts efficiently to unforeseen obstacles, learns from its interactions with the environment, and achieves high success rates in completing navigation tasks without supervision.\",\n",
    "    \"Deep learning engineers have designed a predictive maintenance model that analyzes sensor data from industrial equipment to forecast potential failures before they occur. By using historical data, real-time telemetry, and anomaly detection algorithms, the model helps plant operators anticipate breakdowns, schedule maintenance, and optimize resource allocation. In trials across several manufacturing facilities, the AI system successfully reduced downtime, improved operational efficiency, and enhanced safety by identifying equipment at risk before a catastrophic failure.\",\n",
    "    \"AI-powered natural language processing tools have advanced to the point where they can accurately summarize lengthy legal documents, including contracts, court filings, and regulatory paperwork. These tools use transformer-based architectures to extract key clauses, summarize obligations, and highlight potential risks. Law firms and corporate legal departments are increasingly adopting these tools to reduce the time spent reviewing documents, improve accuracy, and allow legal professionals to focus on higher-value analytical tasks. The technology has the potential to significantly streamline legal workflows and increase access to legal insights.\",\n",
    "    \"A team of AI researchers has developed a machine learning model capable of detecting deepfake videos in real time, an emerging threat in the age of digital misinformation. The system uses a combination of computer vision, temporal analysis, and neural network classifiers to identify subtle inconsistencies in video frames that indicate manipulation. Tested across a large dataset of authentic and manipulated videos, the AI achieved high accuracy, even under challenging conditions such as varying lighting and compression artifacts. This technology is intended to help social media platforms, news organizations, and government agencies combat the spread of deepfake content and protect information integrity.\"\n",

Each generated summary is scored for how accurately it captures the main points of the original article. By examining the correlation and differences between AI and human relevance scores, we can measure the AI’s reliability and consistency in evaluating text quality. This comparison helps validate the automatic evaluation process and ensures it approximates human-level assessment."
