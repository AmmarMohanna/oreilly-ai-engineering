## 📚 Course Overview

The AI engineering field is moving beyond model-centric ML to a product-centric approach that brings foundation models into production. This two-day, hands-on bootcamp distills the essentials of building applications with foundation models, following a "production first" philosophy: start simple, optimize instructions and context before touching the model, and always tie model behavior to user experience and product value.

### What You'll Learn

- **Foundation Models**: Understand the anatomy of foundation models and how to control their behavior through generation settings
- **Evaluation Methods**: Design systematic evaluation pipelines combining AI-as-a-judge metrics with human review
- **Prompt Engineering**: Master prompt design principles, few-shot prompting, and implement guardrails to mitigate attacks
- **RAG & Agents**: Build context through retrieval-augmented generation and tool-based agents
- **Fine-Tuning**: Decide when and how to fine-tune models versus relying on prompts and retrieval
- **Data Engineering**: Source, annotate, synthesize, and process data to support adaptation and evaluation
- **Inference Optimization**: Optimize latency and cost at the model, hardware, and service layers

### Prerequisites

- Python programming experience
- Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts
- Prior exposure to large language models (helpful but not required)
